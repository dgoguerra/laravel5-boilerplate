## Laravel 5.1 boilerplate

Ths project is a base installation of Laravel 5.1 with some base features and views already set up
(such as the [default authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication) provided by Laravel)
as well as some extra features I find useful to reuse between projects.

A vagrant configuration is provided to setup the project in a Ubuntu Trusty machine.

## Official Laravel 5.1 Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1).
